# Ready for GitHub Commit

## Recent Changes Completed
All code changes have been implemented and tested successfully:

### UI Layout Optimizations
- **Wind/Rain Balance**: Changed layout from 50/50 to 60/40 split for better space utilization
- **Font Size Optimization**: Reduced wind speed fonts from 2xl to lg, gust fonts from lg to md
- **Rain Unit Formatting**: Implemented superscript units with responsive sizing (0.5rem to 0.8rem)

### Thermostat Card Improvements  
- **Three-Column Layout**: Separated current temperature, humidity, and target temperature
- **HVAC Status Accuracy**: Fixed status detection using actual equipment state from Beestat API
- **Data Refresh**: Reduced thermostat refresh interval from 3 minutes to 1 minute
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Reduced humidity text size as secondary information

### Technical Improvements
- **Schema Update**: Added hvacState field for actual equipment status tracking
- **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript errors for proper null handling
- **Error Handling**: Improved HVAC detection logic with fallback mechanisms

```
UI refinements: balanced layout, improved thermostat display, superscript units

- Optimized wind/rain card proportions to 60/40 split for better space utilization
- Redesigned thermostat card with three-column layout separating current temp, humidity, and target
- Fixed HVAC status detection to use actual equipment state instead of temperature differences  
- Enhanced data refresh frequency to 1-minute intervals for thermostat data
- Added superscript formatting for rain card units with responsive sizing
- Reduced humidity text size as secondary information
- Improved visual hierarchy and readability across all weather cards
```

## Application Status
- **Server**: Running successfully with weather and thermostat data integration
- **Frontend**: All UI improvements implemented and rendering correctly
- **APIs**: WeatherFlow and Beestat integrations working properly
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states for API failures
- **Documentation**: Complete and up-to-date for public sharing

The weather dashboard is production-ready and all documentation is current for GitHub publication.
