# Ready for GitHub Commit

## Recent Changes Completed
All code changes have been implemented and tested successfully:

### UI Layout Optimizations
- **Wind/Rain Balance**: Changed layout from 50/50 to 60/40 split for better space utilization
- **Font Size Optimization**: Reduced wind speed fonts from 2xl to lg, gust fonts from lg to md
- **Rain Unit Formatting**: Implemented superscript units with responsive sizing (0.5rem to 0.8rem)

### Thermostat Card Improvements  
- **Three-Column Layout**: Separated current temperature, humidity, and target temperature
- **HVAC Status Accuracy**: Fixed status detection using actual equipment state from Beestat API
- **Data Refresh**: Reduced thermostat refresh interval from 3 minutes to 1 minute
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Reduced humidity text size as secondary information

### Kiosk Configuration Enhancements
- **Environment-Controlled Units**: Removed settings UI, units controlled by VITE_UNIT_SYSTEM
- **Parameterized Station Display**: Station name configurable via VITE_STATION_DISPLAY_NAME
- **Complete Environment Setup**: All personal data moved to environment variables

### Technical Improvements
- **Schema Update**: Added hvacState field for actual equipment status tracking
- **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript errors for proper null handling
- **Error Handling**: Improved HVAC detection logic with fallback mechanisms

## Documentation Status
All documentation is current and comprehensive:

### Updated Files
- **replit.md**: Updated with latest UI optimizations and improvements
- **README.md**: Current with all features and setup instructions
- **SETUP.md**: Complete step-by-step configuration guide
- **DEPLOYMENT.md**: Production deployment instructions for multiple platforms
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Development guidelines and contribution process
- **UNIT_SYSTEM.md**: Comprehensive unit conversion documentation

### Ready for Commit
All files are staged and ready for git commit with the following suggested commit message:

```
Kiosk optimization: parameterized config, improved layout, environment-controlled units

- Parameterized station display name via VITE_STATION_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable
- Removed interactive settings UI for kiosk deployment, units controlled by VITE_UNIT_SYSTEM
- Optimized wind/rain card proportions to 60/40 split for better space utilization
- Redesigned thermostat card with three-column layout separating current temp, humidity, and target
- Fixed HVAC status detection to use actual equipment state instead of temperature differences
- Enhanced data refresh frequency to 1-minute intervals for thermostat data
- Added superscript formatting for rain card units with responsive sizing
- Created comprehensive kiosk deployment documentation (KIOSK_SETUP.md)
- All personal data now parameterized for production deployment
```

## Application Status
- **Server**: Running successfully with weather and thermostat data integration
- **Frontend**: All UI improvements implemented and rendering correctly
- **APIs**: WeatherFlow and Beestat integrations working properly
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states for API failures
- **Documentation**: Complete and up-to-date for public sharing

The weather dashboard is production-ready and all documentation is current for GitHub publication.
