# Ecobee Thermostat Integration Setup Guide

## Current Status
✅ **Thermostat card added to dashboard**  
✅ **API framework ready**  
⏳ **Mock data currently displayed** (Living Room: 72.5°F, Bedroom: 70.8°F)  
⚠️ **Real API integration needed**

## Authentication Options

### ❌ **Option 1: Direct Ecobee API (UNAVAILABLE)**
**Ecobee closed new developer registrations in March 2024** - still closed as of July 2025.
- Cannot create new developer accounts
- Cannot get new API keys
- Only existing developers can continue using their keys

### ✅ **Option 2: Seam API (RECOMMENDED)**
Seam provides Ecobee integration without requiring direct API keys.

**Steps:**
1. Sign up at [seam.co](https://seam.co)
2. Create a new project in Seam dashboard
3. Get your Seam API key from dashboard
4. Connect your Ecobee account through Seam's interface
5. Use Seam's API to access thermostat data

**Environment Variables Needed:**
```env
SEAM_API_KEY=your_seam_api_key_here
```

### ✅ **Option 3: Existing Ecobee Developer Account**
If you already have an Ecobee developer account from before March 2024:

**Environment Variables Needed:**
```env
ECOBEE_API_KEY=your_ecobee_api_key
ECOBEE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
ECOBEE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
```

### ✅ **Option 4: Home Assistant Integration**
If you use Home Assistant with Ecobee integration:

**Steps:**
1. Set up Home Assistant with Ecobee integration
2. Enable Home Assistant API
3. Use Home Assistant's REST API to access thermostat data

**Environment Variables Needed:**
```env
HOME_ASSISTANT_URL=http://your-ha-instance:8123
HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN=your_long_lived_access_token
```

## Implementation Status

### Currently Built:
- ✅ Thermostat card UI component
- ✅ Database schema for thermostat data
- ✅ API endpoints (`/api/thermostats/current`)
- ✅ Mock data for testing
- ✅ Dashboard integration

### Next Steps:
1. **Choose your authentication method** from options above
2. **Provide API credentials** using the secrets tool
3. **Replace mock API with real integration**
4. **Test with live thermostat data**

## Thermostat Card Features

The thermostat card shows:
- **Current temperature** for each thermostat location
- **Target temperature** with HVAC mode (heat/cool/auto/off)
- **Temperature difference** from target
- **Humidity levels** (when available)
- **Color-coded modes**: Heat=🔥, Cool=❄️, Auto=🎯, Off=⏸️

## Technical Integration

The thermostat integration is designed to be easily switchable between providers. Currently displays:

**Living Room Thermostat:**
- Current: 72.5°F
- Target: 72.0°F  
- Mode: Cool
- Humidity: 45%

**Bedroom Thermostat:**
- Current: 70.8°F
- Target: 69.0°F
- Mode: Cool  
- Humidity: 42%

## Ready for Real Data

The framework is complete and ready to connect to real thermostats. Choose your preferred authentication method and provide the necessary API keys to replace the mock data with live thermostat readings.
