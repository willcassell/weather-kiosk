# Thermostat Setup Guide

Your weather kiosk is currently using HomeKit simulation to show realistic thermostat data for your "Home" and "Lake" locations. Here's how to connect your actual thermostats:

## Current Status

✅ **Working Now**: HomeKit simulation with realistic data that varies throughout the day  
❌ **Not Working**: Ecobee API (suspended new developer registrations March 2024)

## Option 1: HomeKit Integration (Recommended)

If you have Ecobee or other HomeKit-compatible thermostats:

### Step 1: Enable HomeKit on Your Thermostats

**For Ecobee thermostats:**
1. On your thermostat screen, tap the hamburger menu (☰)
2. Go to **Settings → HomeKit**
3. Enable **"HomeKit Pairing"**
4. A QR code will appear - keep this available

**For other thermostats:**
- Check your thermostat manual for HomeKit setup instructions
- Most modern smart thermostats support HomeKit

### Step 2: Set Up Home Assistant (Recommended)

Home Assistant provides the best local integration:

1. **Install Home Assistant** on a Raspberry Pi or spare computer
2. **Add HomeKit Controller integration** (not cloud-based Ecobee integration)
3. **Scan for your thermostats** using the QR codes from Step 1
4. **Configure REST API** access from your weather kiosk

### Step 3: Update Weather Kiosk

Once Home Assistant is running:

1. Get your Home Assistant IP address and long-lived access token
2. Update the HomeKit integration in your weather kiosk to query Home Assistant
3. Configure your thermostat names as "Home" and "Lake"

## Option 2: Alternative Smart Thermostat APIs

### Nest/Google
- **Google Nest API** - Still accepting new developers
- **Device Access Console** required
- **$5 one-time fee** for device access

### Honeywell
- **Honeywell Total Connect Comfort API**
- Free developer access available
- Good for Honeywell/Resideo thermostats

### Generic IoT Solutions
- **MQTT integration** if your thermostats support it
- **Local API calls** if thermostats have local interfaces

## Option 3: Keep Current Simulation

The current HomeKit simulation provides:
- ✅ **Realistic temperature variations** throughout the day
- ✅ **Proper HVAC cycling behavior** (heat/cool/idle)
- ✅ **Two location support** (Home and Lake)
- ✅ **Visual HVAC status indicators**
- ✅ **No external dependencies**

## Implementation Priority

**Immediate (Working Now)**:
- HomeKit simulation with realistic data
- Visual HVAC status indicators
- Time-based temperature variations

**Next Steps (For Real Data)**:
1. **Home Assistant + HomeKit** - Best local control option
2. **Alternative APIs** - If you don't have HomeKit thermostats
3. **Direct HomeKit** - Advanced option requiring custom protocol implementation

## Technical Details

The current simulation generates realistic data by:
- **Daily temperature cycles** based on time of day
- **HVAC cycling patterns** that mimic real thermostats
- **Target temperature management** (Home: 72°F, Lake: 70°F)
- **Humidity variations** with realistic ranges
- **Mode switching** based on temperature differentials

## Next Steps

1. **Try the current simulation** - It should show realistic thermostat behavior now
2. **Choose your integration path** based on your thermostat type
3. **Let me know your thermostat models** so I can provide specific setup instructions

**The kiosk should now display working thermostat data!** Check the Indoor Climate card to see your Home and Lake temperatures with HVAC status indicators.
